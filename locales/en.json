        "intro": "The collection of problems in physics edited by O.Y. Savchenko has remained one of the most sought-after resources for physics olympiad preparation in post-soviet countries for over 30 years. However, during this time, not a single complete solution manual for this collection has been created.",
        "project": "This website presents a non-profit project aimed at collaboratively creating the first solution manual with solutions from ",
        "moto": "Currently, more than 800 solutions out of 2023 problems have been published. The project, launched in 2023, is actively developing in both Russian and English. ",
        "introFirst": "For over 30 years, the Savchenko physics problem collection has challenged students across post-Soviet countries—yet no comprehensive solution manual existed, until now. <strong>Savchenko Solutions</strong> is the first global, student-led effort to compile and refine detailed explanations for all 2,023 problems. Surpassing 800 published solutions in multiple languages, our thriving platform welcomes learners worldwide to collaborate, share insights, and publish in rigorous peer review.",
        "introSecond": "What began as a modest \"archive\" for personal solutions soon evolved into a vibrant international community, drawing thousands of regular users. This unprecedented collective intelligence fosters an environment where students and teachers learn from one another, transforming how physics is studied and taught — embracing a spirit of open collaboration and proving that knowledge shared is knowledge multiplied.",
