t# Savchenko Physics Problems Solutions

The collection of physics problems edited by **O.Y. Savchenko** has been a cornerstone resource for physics olympiad preparation in post-Soviet countries for over 30 years. Despite its widespread use, no complete solution manual for this collection has ever been createdâ€”until now.

## About the Project

This project is a **non-profit, collaborative effort** aimed at creating the first comprehensive solution manual for Savchenko's collection. It features contributions from [different authors](https://savchenkosolutions.com/about#team) working together to make these solutions accessible.

- **Current Progress**: Over **745 solutions** out of 2023 problems have been published.
- **Languages**: The project is actively developed in both **Russian** and **English**.
- **Launch Year**: 2023.
