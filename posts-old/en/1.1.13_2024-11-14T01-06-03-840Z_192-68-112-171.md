###  Statement 

$1.1.13.$ From the graph of the dependence of the coordinate on time, graph the dependence of the velocity on time.

### Solution
1
![ Two different velocities |886x271, 59%](../../img/1.1.13/01.png)  Two different velocities 

In this periodic motion, two velocity regimes can be distinguished: when the velocity is positive and when it is negative. 

Based on the speed definition, the speed in each mode will be $20 \, \text{m/s}$ and $10 \, \text{m/s}$, respectively:
