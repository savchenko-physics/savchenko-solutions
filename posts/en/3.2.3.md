###  Statement 

$3.2.3.$ A weight is oscillating vertically on a rubber cord. How many times will the period of vertical oscillations of the weight change if it is suspended on the same cord folded in half? 

### Solution

We find the period of oscillations on a standard cord as the period of oscillations of a spring pendulum $$ T_1=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} $$ When we fold the cord, we change its length and width and, accordingly, its stiffness $k'$ changes $$ T_2=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k'}} $$ Since the spring is divided into two and the length of each half is $l/2$ and the stiffness of each of them is $k_1=2k$; by adding the two halves in parallel we obtain a parallel connection $$ k'=2k_1=4k $$ We substitute the oscillation period of the “new” cord into the expression for $T_2$ $$ T_2=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{4k}}=\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} $$ From where we obtain the ratio of the periods of oscillations $$ \boxed{\frac{T_1}{T_2}=2} $$ 

#### Answer

The period will be halved
