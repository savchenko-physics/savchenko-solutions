###  Statement 

$1.3.27^*.$ A spherical tank standing on the ground has a radius of $R$. What is the lowest speed at which a rock thrown from the ground can fly over the reservoir just by touching its top? 

### Solution

The stone must be thrown at an angle $\alpha$ to the horizon, satisfying the equations obtained in [1.3.6](../1.3.6):

$$v_x = v \cos\alpha ; \quad v_y = v \sin\alpha - gt;$$ $$x = vt \cos\alpha ; \quad y = vt \sin\alpha - gt^2 / 2.$$ 

The time it takes for the stone to rise to the maximum height $2R$ is found as

$$ t_1 = \frac{v_0 \sin\alpha}{g} $$ 

The maximum height of the stone lift along the vertical axis should be equal to $y_{max} = 2R$, therefore

$$ \frac{v_0^2 \sin^2 \alpha}{2g} = 2R $$ 

Determine the value of the initial throw speed

$$ v_0 = \sqrt{\frac{4gR}{\sin^2 \alpha}} $$ 

The angle $\alpha$ at which the stone should be thrown is determined from the initial conditions

$$ v_0t_1 \cos\alpha = \frac{v_0^2 \sin\alpha\cos\alpha}{g}$$ $$ 2R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin\alpha\cos\alpha}{g}$$ $$\tan\alpha = 2; \quad \alpha = \text{\arctan } \;2 \approx 63^\circ$$ 

Substituting into the formula for $v_0$

$$ \fbox{$v_0 = \sqrt{\frac{4gR}{\sin^2 63^\circ}} = \sqrt{5Rg}$} $$ 

#### Answer

$$v = \sqrt{5gR}$$
