###  Statement

$3.2.17.$ A spacecraft rotates around its axis with angular velocity $\omega$. How does the period of oscillation of a pendulum of length $l$ depend on the distance $R$ of the suspension point to the axis of rotation? The plane of oscillation passes through the axis of rotation.

![ The pendulum deflected a small distance $x$ |158x511, 11%](../../img/3.2.17/3.2.17_1.png)

When rotating along an arc of a circle of radius $l$, the ball is subject to centripetal acceleration

$$
a = \omega^2(R+l)
$$

Newton's second law for a ball:

$$
m\ddot{x}(t)=-m\omega^2(R+l)\sin\varphi
$$

Neglecting gravitational interaction with the Earth, we write Newton's second law

$$
m\ddot{x}(t)+m\omega^2(R+l)\sin\varphi=0\tag{1}
$$

Let's use the approximation for small angles $(\varphi \ll 1)$:

$$
\sin\varphi\approx\varphi=\frac{x}{l}
$$

Using the approximation for $(1)$, we obtain the equation of harmonic oscillations

$$
\ddot{x}(t)+\frac{\omega^2(R+l)}{l}x(t)=0
$$

We solve the equation of harmonic oscillations of the form $\ddot{x}+\omega^2x(t)=0$ using the standard method and obtain the desired oscillation period

$$
\boxed{T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}\sqrt{\frac{l}{R+l}}}
$$

#### Answer

$$
T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}\sqrt{\frac{l}{R+l}}
$$
