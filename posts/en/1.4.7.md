###  Statement

$1.4.7^*.$ What is the duration of a plane's flight from Novosibirsk to Moscow and back in a straight line, if the wind blows at an angle $\alpha$ to the track at a speed $u$ during the entire flight? The speed of the aircraft relative to the air $v$, the length of the route $L$. In which wind direction is the maximum flight duration?

For the plane to fly on course, the following conditions must be met

$$
u \sin\alpha = v \sin\beta
$$

Where from

$$
\cos\beta = \sqrt{1 - u^2 \sin^2 \alpha / v^2}
$$

And the total time there and back

$$
t_1 = \frac{L}{v \cos\beta + u \cos\alpha}
$$

$$
t_2 = \frac{L}{v\cos\beta - u \cos\alpha}
$$

We find the full time as

$$
t=t_1+t_2
$$

Substitute the value of $\cos\beta$:

$$
t=\frac{L}{\sqrt{v^2 - u^2 \sin^2 \alpha} + u \cos\alpha} + \frac{L}{\sqrt{v^2 - u^2 \sin^2 \alpha} - u \cos\alpha}
$$

$$
t=L\frac{\sqrt{v^2 - u^2 \sin^2 \alpha}+\sqrt{v^2 - u^2 \sin^2 \alpha} }{(\sqrt{v^2 - u^2 \sin^2 \alpha} + u \cos\alpha )(\sqrt{v^2 - u^2 \sin^2 \alpha} - u \cos\alpha )}
$$

$$
t=\frac{2L\sqrt{v^2 - u^2 \sin^2 \alpha}}{(\sqrt{v^2 - u^2 \sin^2 \alpha} + u \cos\alpha )(\sqrt{v^2 - u^2 \sin^2 \alpha} - u \cos\alpha )}
$$

Expressing the required time:

$$
\fbox{$t=\frac{2L\sqrt{v^2 - u^2 \sin^2 \alpha}}{v^{2}-u^{2}}$}
$$

#### Answer

$$
t=\frac{2L\sqrt{v^{2}-u^{2}\operatorname{sin}^{2}\alpha}}{v^{2}-u^{2}}.\textrm{ Along the highway}.
