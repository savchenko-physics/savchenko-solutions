Let's consider the Newton Second Law for both axis. Firstly, for $x$-axis,

$$
N_1+f_{r2} = mg
$$

$$
N_1+\mu_2 N_2 = mg \quad(1)
$$

For $y$-axis,

$$
N_2 = f_{r1}
$$

$$
N_2 = \mu_1 N_1 \quad(2)
$$

Substituting $(2)$ into $(1)$:

$$
N_1 (1+\mu_1 \mu_2) = mg \quad(3)
$$

Applying Newton Second Law for the rotation about the pivot point,

$$
\sum \vec{\tau} = \vec{0}
$$

$$
-mg\frac{l}{2}\sin{\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha}+N_1 l\sin{\frac{\pi}{2}+\alpha}-f_{r1} l \sin{\pi -\alpha} = 0
$$

where $l$ is the staircase's length. Now, for avoiding that staircase slides over ground $\sum \tau\leq 0$, then

$$
-mg\frac{l}{2}\sin{\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha}+N_1 l\sin{\frac{\pi}{2}+\alpha}-f_{r1} l \sin{\pi -\alpha} \leq 0
$$

$$
-mg\frac{l}{2}\sin{\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha}+N_1 l\sin{\frac{\pi}{2}+\alpha}-\mu_1 N_1 l \sin{\pi -\alpha} \leq 0
$$

Developing the above expression,

$$
mg \geq 2N_1(1-\mu_1 \tan{\alpha}) \quad(4)
$$

Putting $(3)$ into $(4)$, and separating $\tan{\alpha}$ term,

$$
\boxed{\tan{\alpha} \geq \frac{1-\mu_1 \mu_2}{2 \mu_1}}
$$
