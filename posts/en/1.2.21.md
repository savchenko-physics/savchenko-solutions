###  Statement

$1.2.21^*.$ The scheduled departure time of the train is $12.00$. It's $12.00$ on your watch, but the penultimate car that moves past you during time $t_1$ is already starting to pass by you. The last car passes you during $t_2$. The train left on time and is moving equidistant. How far behind is your watch?

### Solution

$$
l=\nu_{1}t_{1} +\frac{at_{1}^{2}}{2}
$$

$$
l=(\nu_{1}+at_{1})t_{2} +\frac{at_{1}^{2}}{2}
$$

$$
(\nu_{1}+at_{1})t_{2} +\frac{at_{1}^{2}}{2} = \nu_{1}t_{1} +\frac{at_{1}^{2}}{2}
$$

Given that $\nu_{1} = a{d}t$:

$$
a{d}t(t_{1}-t_{2}) =\frac{a(t_{2}-2t_{1}t_{2}-t_{1}^{2})}{2}
$$

$$
{d}t=\fbox{$\frac{t_{2}-2t_{1}t_{2}-t_{1}^{2}}{2(t_{1}-t_{2})}$}
$$

#### Answer

$$
\frac{t_{2}-2t_{1}t_{2}-t_{1}^{2}}{2(t_{1}-t_{2})}
$$
