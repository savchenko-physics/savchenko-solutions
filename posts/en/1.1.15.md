###  Statement 

$1.1.15.$ Using the velocity-time graphs, plot the coordinate-time graphs. In cases $b$ and $c$ find the average velocity over a large time.

### Solution

![ Graph-a of time dependence of coordinate |571x338, 67%](../../img/1.1.15/sol.png)  

Taking into account the physical meaning of the area under the graph of velocity versus time, we obtain the graphs of the dependence of the coordinate on time. 

![ Graph-b of time velocity of time |1552x395, 67%](../../img/1.1.15/graph1.png)

In case $b$), in equal time intervals, the body travels forward and backward the same distance. Consequently, for a large time, the displacement will be close to zero and the average velocity will be zero. 

$$v_{av} = 0 \text{ m/s}$$

![ Graph-c of time velocity of time |1561x400, 67%](../../img/1.1.15/graph2.png)

In case $c$) for equal time intervals, the body is no longer travelling equal distances. For every 4 seconds, it moves in the positive direction by 4 meters. 

Here we go: 

$$v_{av} = 1 \text{ m/s}$$

#### Answer

a) See figure; 
b) $v_{av} = 0$, 
c) $v_{av} = 1 \text{ m/s}$
