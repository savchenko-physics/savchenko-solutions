###  Statement 

$1.3.9.$ At what speed should a projectile fly out of a cannon at the moment of rocket launch in order to hit a rocket starting vertically with acceleration $a$? The distance from the gun to the rocket launch site is $L$, the gun fires at an angle of $45^\circ$ to the horizon. 

### Solution

Let's use the formula for the $x$ and $y$ coordinates obtained in [1.3.6](../1.3.6): $$ y(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}vt - \frac{gt^2}{2} $$ $$ x(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}vt $$ In this case, the equation describing the rocketâ€™s motion is: $$ y(t) = \frac{at^2}{2} $$ We write down the meeting conditions: $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}vt - \frac{gt^2}{2} = \frac{at^2}{2}\tag{1} $$ $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}vt = L $$ Where, moment of meeting: $$ t = \frac{\sqrt{2}L}{v} $$ $$ L=\frac{v\sqrt{2}}{g} $$ Substitute into $(1)$: $$ \frac{v\sqrt{2}}{g} = \frac{(a+g)v^2}{g} $$ We obtain the required speed: $$ \fbox{$ v=\sqrt{L(a+g)} $} $$ 

#### Answer

$$v=\sqrt{L(a+g)}$$
