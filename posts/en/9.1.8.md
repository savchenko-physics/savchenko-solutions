### Solution

Let's consider a small deviation from equilibrium by an angle $\alpha$:

The moment acting on the frame from the magnetic field:

$$
M = BIS\cdot \sin\alpha = BIa^2 \sin\alpha
$$

where $a$ is the side of the frame

gravity does not create a moment as it passes through the point of rotation

From the basic equation of rotational motion:

$$
J\ddot{\alpha} = \sum\pm{M_i}
$$

for our case:

$$
J\ddot{\alpha} = -BIa^2 \sin\alpha\tag{1}
$$

now we will find the moment of inertia $J$ of the frame during the observed oscillations

The moment of inertia of the upper and lower sides of the frame is

$$
J_1=J_2 = \frac{m}{4}\cdot \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{m a^2}{16}\tag{2}
$$

where $a/2$ is the distance to this side.

Moment of inertia of the lateral sides:

$$
J_3 = J_4 = \frac{1}{12} \cdot \frac{m}{4}\cdot a^2 = \frac{m a^2}{48}\tag{3}
$$

We find the moment of inertia $J$ by substituting $(2)$ and $(3)$

$$
J = J_1 + J_2 + J_3 + J_4
$$

$$
J = 2\cdot \frac{m a^2}{16} + 2 \cdot \frac{m a^2}{48} = \frac{m a^2}{6}
$$

then equation $(1)$ will look like:

$$
\frac{m a^2}{6}\ddot{\alpha} = -BIa^2 \sin\alpha
$$

$$
\ddot{\alpha} = -\frac{6BI}{m} \alpha (t)
$$

Solving the equation of harmonic oscillations, we find the oscillation frequency

$$
\boxed{\omega = \sqrt{\frac{6BI}{m}}}
$$

#### Answer

$$
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{6BI}{m}}
$$
