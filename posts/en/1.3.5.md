###  Statement

$1.3.5.$ A stone is thrown at a velocity $v$ at an angle $\varphi$ to the horizon. After what time will the velocity be at the angle $\alpha$ with the horizon?

### Solution

The horizontal component of velocity remains unchanged:

$$
v_{x}(\varphi) = v_{x}(\alpha ) = v \cdot \cos{\varphi}
$$

And the horizontal component decreases, depending on time, according to the law:

$$
v_{y}(t) = vt \sin{\varphi} - gt
$$

From where the angle that the velocity makes with the horizon is determined as:

$$
\tan{\alpha} = \frac{v_{y}(t)}{v_x}
$$

Or,

$$
\tan{\alpha} \cdot v \cdot \cos{\varphi} = v \cdot \sin{\varphi} - gt
$$

From where we obtain the required moment of time:

$$
\fbox{$t= \frac{v}{g}(\sin{\varphi} - \cos{\varphi}\tan{\alpha})$}
$$

#### Answer

$$
t= \frac{v}{g}(\sin{\varphi} - \cos{\varphi}\tan{\alpha})
$$
