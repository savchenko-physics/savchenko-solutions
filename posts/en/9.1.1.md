###  Statement

$9.1.1.$ A force of $15 \mathrm{~N}$ acts on a linear conductor of length $10\mathrm{~cm}$, located perpendicular to a magnetic field, if the current in the conductor is $1.5\mathrm{~A}$. Find the induction of the magnetic field.

### Solution

We find the Ampere force as

$$
\vec{F} = (\vec{Il})\times \vec{B}
$$

In scalar form, this expression can be rewritten as

$$
F = B\cdot Il \cdot \sin\alpha\tag{1}
$$

since the field is perpendicular to the current element, then

$$
\alpha =90^{\circ};\quad \sin\alpha =1
$$

From here, we rewrite the expression $(1)$ as

$$
F = B \cdot Il \Rightarrow \boxed{B = \frac{F}{Il} = 100\text{ T}}
$$

#### Answer

$$
B = \frac{F}{Il} = 100\text{ T}
$$
