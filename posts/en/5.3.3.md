###  Statement

$5.3.3.$ Estimate how many times per $1 \text{ s}$ in $1 \text{ cm}^3$ of air nitrogen molecules collide with each other and nitrogen molecules collide with oxygen molecules.

### Solution

In [5.3.1](../5.3.1) we obtained a formula for the mean free path of gas molecules

$$
\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\pi d^2n}\tag{1}
$$

From this estimate it follows that the average number of collisions that will occur with a gas molecule after passing the path $dx$ will be

$$
N = \sqrt{2}\pi d^2n\cdot dx\tag{2}
$$

From here, dividing by a small time interval $dt$, we obtain the number of collisions occurring with the molecule during a given time interval

$$
Z = \sqrt{2}\pi d^2n \cdot\frac{dx}{dt}\tag{3}
$$

Let us rewrite expression $(3)$, taking into account the definition of velocity $u = \frac{dx}{dt}$:

$$
\boxed{Z = \sqrt{2}\pi d^2n u}\tag{4}
$$

The average speed of gas molecules with a molar mass of $\mu$ can be found in approximation using the formula for the mean-square speed of molecules

$$
u = \sqrt{ \frac{3RT}{\mu}}\quad(5.1)
$$

However, for a more accurate estimate we will use the average speed formula

$$
u = \sqrt{ \frac{8RT}{\pi\mu}}\quad(5.2)
$$

According to Dalton's law, the total atmospheric pressure will be the sum of the pressures created by the molecules of nitrogen $N_2$ and oxygen $O_2$

$$
p_a=p_{N_2}+p_{O_2}\tag{6}
$$

The atmosphere consists of $78\%$ nitrogen $N_2$ and $21\%$ oxygen $O_2$, with $1\%$ occupied by other gases

Then, from the Ideal Gas Equation, we obtain the concentration of nitrogen and oxygen molecules, respectively

$$
n_{N_2}=\frac{0.78\cdot p_a}{RT}\tag{7}
$$

$$
n_{O_2}=\frac{0.2\cdot p_a}{RT}\tag{8}
$$

Hence, the number of collisions of nitrogen molecules with each other per unit of time. Considering that each oscillation occurs between two molecules simultaneously, we multiply by $\frac{1}{2}$:

$$
Z_{NN}=\frac{N\cdot Z_N}{2}=\frac{0.78\cdot p_a}{RT}\cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\pi d_N^2\cdot \sqrt{ \frac{8RT}{\pi\mu _N}}\tag{9}
$$

$$
\boxed{Z_{NN}=1.56p_a\cdot d_N^2\cdot \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{RT\mu_N}}}\approx6\cdot10^{28}\text{ s}^{-1}\cdot\text{cm}^{-3}\tag{10}
$$

Similarly, the number of collisions of nitrogen molecules with oxygen molecules

$$
Z_{ON}=N\cdot Z_O=\frac{0.21\cdot p_a}{RT}\cdot \sqrt{2} \pi d_O^2 \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{8RT}{\pi\mu _O}}\tag{11}
$$

$$
\boxed{Z_{ON}=0.84p_a\cdot d_O^2\cdot \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{RT\mu_O}}}\approx3\cdot10^{28}\text{ s}^{-1}\cdot\text{cm}^{-3}\tag{12}
$$

#### Answer

$$
\nu_1\approx6\cdot10^{28}\text{ s}^{-1}\cdot\text{cm}^{-3}; ~\nu_2\approx3\cdot10^{28}\text{ s}^{-1}\cdot\text{cm}^{-3}.
$$
