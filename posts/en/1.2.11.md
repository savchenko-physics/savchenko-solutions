###  Statement

$1.2.11.$ a. In a conical vessel, the water level rises at a constant rate $v_0$. How does the rate of water entering a vessel through a tube of section $s$ depend on time? At time zero, the vessel is empty.

b. A jet of oil hitting the surface of the water spreads over it in a round spot of thickness $h$. How does the speed of movement of the spot boundary depend on time, if the volume of oil $q$ enters per unit of time? At the initial time, the spot radius is zero.

$a)$ By time $t,$ the water level will be $v_0t$. And the rate of change of volume will be equal to:

$$
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{\pi r(t)^2 dx}{dt}
$$

Where $dx$ is the change in water level:

$$
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r(t)^2 v_0
$$

From Geometry:

$$
r(t) = v_0 t \cdot \tan\alpha
$$

By definition, the velocity of incoming water is equal to

$$
v = \frac{dV}{sdt}
$$

Substituting the previous expressions:

$$
v = {\pi v_0^3 t^2 \cdot \tan^2(\alpha )}/s
$$

$b)$ For a small time interval $dt$, the volume changes by

$$
dV = q dt
$$

Also the volume increment can be written as

$$
dV = 2\pi r dr \cdot h
$$

Thus:

$$
q dt = 2\pi r dr \cdot h
$$

Considering $v = \frac{dr}{dt}$,

$$
\fbox{$v = \frac{q}{2\pi r h}$}
$$

#### Answer

$$
v=\frac{\pi v_0^3t^2\operatorname{tg}^2\alpha}{s};\quad v=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{q}{\pi ht}}
$$
