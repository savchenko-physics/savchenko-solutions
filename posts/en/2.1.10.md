###  Statement

$2.1.10.$ Astronauts wearing spacesuits train in water to prepare for work in zero gravity. In this case, the force of gravity acting on them is balanced by the buoyant force. What is the difference between such" weightlessness " and the real one?

### Solution

When simulating weightlessness in a pool, the astronauts are subject to the force of resistance of the environment, which will prevent them from moving by inertia. In addition, the internal organs of the astronauts in the pool will not be in a state of weightlessness and will function differently than in zero-gravity conditions.
