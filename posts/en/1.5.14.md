###  Statement

$1.5.14^*.$ Four turtles are located at the vertices of a square with side $a$. They start moving simultaneously at a constant modulo velocity $v$. Each turtle moves clockwise in the direction of its neighbor. Where will the turtles meet and after what time?

### Solution

Consider the change in the coordinates of the turtles over a short period of time $dt$

Over time $dt$ the distance between neighboring turtles changed from $a$ to $a'$

Express $a'$ using the Pythagorean theorem

$$
a' = \sqrt{(a-dx)^2 - d^2x}
$$

Considering the smallness of the value $dx$

$$
a' = \sqrt{a^2 - 2a\, dx}
$$

$$
a' = a\sqrt{1 - \frac{2dx}{a}}
$$

We will use the formula for small quantities $(1+x)^\alpha\approx 1+\alpha x$, where $x\rightarrow 0$:

$$
a' = a - dx
$$

Thus, the increment of the coordinate $a$ is

$$
da = a' - a = dx
$$

Hence, the rate of change of distance between the turtles is

$$
u = \frac{da}{dt} = -\frac{dx}{dt}=-v
$$

From this it follows that after $a=0$, after a period of time

$$
t = a/v
$$

From the symmetry of the problem, it follows that all turtles will go the same way and end up in the center of the square.

NO: It would be interesting to know what would happen if it were not a square? If there were not $4$ turtles, but $n$ ones?

#### Answer

At the center of the square after time $t = a/v$.
