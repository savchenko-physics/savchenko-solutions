###  Statement

$1.4.1.$ The initial positions and velocities of the two ships are shown in the figure. Ships move without acceleration. How do I find the smallest distance between them?

### Solution

In the reference frame of the second ship, the first one moves in a straight line along the vector $v_1 âˆ’ v_2$.

The perpendicular dropped onto this line from the location of the second ship will be the smallest distance.
