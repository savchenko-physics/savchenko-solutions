###  Statement

$3.1.6.$ Determine the maximum velocity of a ball of a mathematical pendulum of length $l$ moving in one plane if the amplitude of the displacement at small oscillations of the pendulum is equal to $x_0$.

### Solution

The motion of a mathematical pendulum is described by the solution of the equation of harmonic oscillations

$$
x = x_0\sin\omega t
$$

Where $\omega$ is the cyclic frequency of oscillations

$$
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}
$$

Let's take the derivative of $x(t)$:

$$
v = \dot{x}(t) = \omega\cdot x_0\cos\omega t
$$

Making the maximum speed equal to

$$
\boxed{\upsilon_\text{max}=x_0\omega =x_0\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}}
$$

#### Answer

$$
\upsilon_\text{max}=x_0\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}
$$
