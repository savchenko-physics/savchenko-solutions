###  Statement 

$1.1.3.$ A bug flew into the room through an open window. The distance from the bug to the ceiling changed with a speed of 1 m/s, the distance to the wall opposite to the window changed with a speed of 2 m/s, to the side wall - with a speed of 2 m/s. After 1 s of flight the bug hit the corner between the ceiling and the side wall of the room. Determine the speed of the bugâ€™s flight and the position in the window through which it flew into the room. The room is 2.5 m high, 4 m wide, and 4 m long. 

### Solution

Let the beetle hit the corner $B$. It is known that after one second of flight the beetle has hit point $B$, so the window is at a distance of $1$ m from the ceiling, since with respect to the ceiling its velocity has changed by $1$ m/s. 

Relative to the side wall, its velocity changed by $2$ m/s. Therefore, it flew at a distance of $2$ m from the side wall. Point $A$ is the place where the beetle flew into the room. 

The coordinates of point $A$: $1$ m from the ceiling and $2$ m from the side wall. Knowing the change of velocities along the three directions $XYZ$, let's find the flight velocity of the beetle: 

$$v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}, \quad(1)$$ 

Let's substitute the values of velocity projections into $(1)$ 

$$v = \sqrt{2^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = 3 \; \frac{m}{s}$$ 

#### Answer

A beetle flew into the room at point $A$ located $1$ m from the ceiling and $2$ m from the side wall with a velocity of $3\, m/s$
