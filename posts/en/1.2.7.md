###  Statement

$1.2.7.$ The bus moves for $20$ seconds in a straight line to the stop, passing a distance of $310 \text{ m}$. Its initial speed is $15~\mathrm{\frac{m}{s}}$. Prove that the velocity of the bus changes in direction.

### Solution

Since the bus comes to a complete stop at the end, the average speed is

$$
v_\text{average}=\frac{15+0}{2}~ \mathrm{\frac{m}{s}}=7.5~ \mathrm{\frac{m}{s}}
$$

If there is an equal-accelerated motion, then the body must travel a path

$$
s = v_\text{average}\cdot t=150\text{ m}
$$

Whence it follows that the body has accelerated, but the motion is not equal-accelerated

#### Answer

The average velocity is greater than the initial velocity and the final velocity is zero.
