###  Statement 

$1.3.15.$ A ball is launched along the inner surface of a smooth vertical cylinder of radius $R$ at an angle $\alpha$ to the vertical. What initial velocity must be given to it so that it returns to the starting point? 

### Solution

We will divide the movement into vertical and in the plane of the cross section of the cylinder

$$x = vt \sin\alpha$$

$$ y = vt \cos\alpha - \frac{gt^2}{2} $$ 

We take into account that the displacement along $Ox$ is equal to the circumference, and along $Oy$ â€” 0:

$$ vt \cos\alpha - \frac{gt^2}{2} = 0 $$ 

$$vt \sin\alpha = 2\pi n R,\,n\in \mathbb{N}$$ We find time $t$ as $$ t = \frac{2\pi n R}{v \sin\alpha} $$ $$ 2v \cos\alpha = g\frac{2\pi n R}{v \sin\alpha} $$ 

From here we express $v$: 

$$\fbox{$v=\sqrt{2\pi Rgn/\sin2\alpha}$}$$ 

#### Answer

$v=\sqrt{2\pi Rgn/\sin2\alpha}$, where $n$ is any natural number; when $\alpha = 0$, the speed can be any in absolute value.
