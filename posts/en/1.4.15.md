###  Statement 

$1.4.15^*.$ There is a bundle of identical nuclei moving with velocity $v$. The nuclei in the beam spontaneously divide into pairs of identical fragments. The velocity of the fragments moving in the direction of the beam is $3v$. Find the velocity of the fragments moving in the direction perpendicular to the beam. 

### Solution

Let's move to the beam center of mass frame.

In this frame of reference, the relative velocity is related to the velocity in the NFR by the relation

$$ \vec{v'} = \vec{v} + \vec{v}_{rel} $$

Where $\vec{v'}$ and $\vec{v}$ are the velocity in the inertial reference frame and the velocity of the reference frame of the system, respectively.

By the condition, when $\vec{v}_{rel}$ and $\vec{v}$ are co-directed $v' = 3 v$

From where

$$v_{rel} = 2v$$

Next, let's consider the fragments that flew with the speed of $\vec{v}_\perp$)

Going back to inertial reference frame, we get that 

$$\vec{v}_\perp = \vec{v}_{rel}-\vec{v}$$

By the Pythagorean theorem

$$\fbox{${v}_\perp = 3{v}$}$$

#### Answer

$$\sin\alpha = u/v$$
