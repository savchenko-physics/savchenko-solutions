###  Statement 

$3.1.7.$ A horizontal trough to the left of the bottom line is bent on a cylindrical surface of radius $r$, and to the right, on a surface of radius $R$. Determine the ratio of the largest deflections to the left and to the right during small oscillations of the body in this trough.

### Solution

According to the law of conservation of body energy, the maximum potential energy will be conserved in both cases $$ E_{p1}=E_{p2} $$ And therefore the height $h$ will rise relative to the lower point of the trajectory to which the body will rise will be equal

We will use the expression $\Delta U$ for small oscillations obtained in [3.1.5](../3.1.5) $$ \Delta U = \frac{mgx_1^2}{2r}=\frac{mgx_2^2}{2R} $$ Whence it follows that $$ \boxed{\frac{x_2}{x_1}=\sqrt{\frac{R}{r}}} $$ 

#### Answer

$$\frac{x_2}{x_1}=\sqrt{\frac{R}{r}}$$
