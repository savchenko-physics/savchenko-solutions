###  Statement 

$1.2.10.$ From a hemispherical aquarium of radius $R$ filled with water, a volume of liquid $q$ evaporates from a unit of the water surface per unit of time. How long will it take for the water to evaporate? 

### Solution

Let's use the Method of Dimensions 

$$[q] = \mathrm{\frac{m^3}{s \cdot m^2}} \Leftrightarrow [q] = \mathrm{\frac{m}{s}}$$ 

What corresponds to 

$$t = R/q$$ 

As the radius of the aquarium increases, water flows out slower, and the opposite is true as $q$ increases. 

#### Answer

$$t = \frac{R}{q}$$
