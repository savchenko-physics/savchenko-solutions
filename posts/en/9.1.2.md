###  Statement

$9.1.2.$ A charge of $1$ C moving at a speed of $1 \text{ m/s}$ in a magnetic field is acted upon by a force of $10$ N. The charge moves at an angle of $30^{\circ}$ to the direction of the magnetic field induction. What is the induction of this field?

### Solution

Lorentz force acting on a moving particle in a magnetic field

$$
\vec{F} = q(\vec{v}\times \vec{B})
$$

rewriting in scalar form we get

$$
F = qvB\sin\alpha
$$

where $\alpha$ is the angle between $\vec{B}$ and $\vec{v}$

Substituting the values ​​from the condition, we get

$$
\boxed{{B} = \frac{F}{qv \sin\alpha} = 20 \text{ T}}
$$

#### Answer

$$
{B} = \frac{F}{qv \sin\alpha} = 20 \text{ T}
$$
