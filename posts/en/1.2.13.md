###  Statement

$1.2.13.$ "The ship was going at the limit, further acceleration was not provided for by the instructions of the space Fleet. An hour later, the speed increased by a thousand kilometers per second" (Kir Bulychev. Agent KF / / Chemistry and Life. 1984. No. 12, p. 111). Find the acceleration of the ship. How many times does it exceed the acceleration of gravity on Earth?

### Solution

1\. Determine the acceleration of the ship

$$
a=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=278 ~\mathrm{\frac{m}{s}}
$$

2\. Let's relate the acceleration of the spaceplane to the acceleration of free fall on Earth

$$
\frac{a}{g}=27.8\text{ times}
$$
