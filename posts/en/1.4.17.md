###  Statement

$1.4.17.$ It is raining heavily. Drop rate $u$. The ball slides on the asphalt at a speed of $v$. How many times in the same period of time does it get more drops than the same, but stationary ball? Does the answer change if the ball is not round?

### Solution

During time $t$, all the drops that are in a cylinder of height $ut$ and base area $S_1$ equal to the area of ​​the central cross-section of the ball perpendicular to $u$ fall on a stationary ball. That is, in the first case

$$
N_1 = utS_1
$$

In the second case, we move to the reference frame of a rolling ball, then the drops fall on it with a speed of

$$
u_1 = \sqrt{u^2 + v^2}
$$

$$
N_2 = u_1 t S_2
$$

where $S_2$ is equal to the area of ​​the central cross-section of the ball perpendicular to $u_1$. For a ball-ball $S_1 = S_2 = S$, and then

$$
N_2 = \sqrt{u^2 + v^2} t S
$$

Where we get the desired ratio

$$
\fbox{$\dfrac{N_2}{N_1} = \sqrt{1 + \dfrac{v^2}{u^2}}$}
$$

When the ball has a shape different from a sphere, its cross-sectional area will vary from the plane of the section

$$
S_1\neq S_2\neq S
$$

Thus, the answer obtained will also vary depending on the shape of the ball

#### Answer

More drops fall on a rolling ball in $\dfrac{N_2}{N_1} = \sqrt{1 + \dfrac{v^2}{u^2}}$ times.
