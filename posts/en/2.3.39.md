###  Statement

$2.3.39.$ One research institute decided to use an expression for the potential energy of point charges in the form $U' = \frac{kqQ}{r} - \frac{kqQ}{R}$, where $R$ is a constant distance set once and for all. Will using $U'$ instead of $U = \frac{kqQ}{r}$ affect the results of particle motion calculations?

### Solution

Expression for the potential energy

$$
U = \frac{kqQ}{r}
$$

$$
U' = \frac{kqQ}{r} - \frac{kqQ}{R}
$$

By statement, $R$ is a constant distance

$$
R = \text{const}
$$

Derivatives for potential energy of expressions

$$
(U_x)' = p
$$

$$
(U)' = - \frac{kqQ}{r^2} \, dr
$$

$$
(U')' = - \frac{kqQ}{r^2} \, dr
$$

The derivative of the constant is zero

$$
(\text{const})' = 0 \Rightarrow (R)' = 0
$$

$$
(U)' = (U')'!
$$

Thus, the speeds remain unchanged and the motion of the particles is not affected

$$
V = V'!
$$
