###  Statement 

$1.2.8^*.$ The particle, after leaving the source, flies at a constant speed for a distance $L$, and then decelerates with acceleration $a$. At what speed will the particle have the shortest travel time from its departure to its stop? 

### Solution

On a constant velocity interval, the velocity is: 

$$v_0 = \frac{L}{t}$$ 

During the deceleration interval the velocity changes as 

$$v(t) = v_0-at \Rightarrow v_0=at$$

Equating the equations, we obtain 

$$L=at^2$$

From where 

$$v_0 = \sqrt{La}$$ 

#### Answer

$$v = \sqrt{La}$$
