###  Statement 

$10.2.11.$ Find the drift velocity of a particle with charge $q$ in the magnetic field of induction $B$ and the field of constant force $F$ perpendicular to each other. 

### Solution

Drift velocity is achieved when particle's path is unaffected respect to force fields that acting over it. So, absolute values of these forces are equal and their directions are opposed. Hence, 

$$F = q~v_d~B$$

$$v_d = \frac{F}{qB}$$

#### Answer

$$v_d = \frac{F}{qB}$$
