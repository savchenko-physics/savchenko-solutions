###  Statement

$2.1.13.$ A system of three identical balls connected by identical springs is suspended on a thread. The thread is burned out. Find the acceleration of the balls immediately after burning the thread.

### Solution

![ Forces acting on the system |842x756, 46%](../../img/2.1.13/draw.png)

Let's write the equilibrium condition for the two lower balls on the vertical and horizontal axes

$$
\left\\{\begin{matrix} mg = F_1 \sin\alpha\\\ F_x = F_1 \cos\alpha& \end{matrix}\right.
$$

where $P$ is the painter's pressure force on the chair.

And for the upper ball

$$
T = mg + 2F_1 \sin\alpha
$$

$$
T = 3mg
$$

Accordingly, when the thread burns out, the upper ball will be acted upon downwards by a force of $T=3mg$. From Newton's second law, we find its initial acceleration as

$$
a = \frac{T}{m} = 3g
$$

The lower balls will be acted upon in the horizontal direction by the force $F_x$, which will be compensated by the force $F_1 \cos\alpha$, and the force of gravity $mg$ â€” $F_1 \sin\alpha$

Thus, the lower balls will be in zero gravity

$$
a=0
$$

#### Answer

The acceleration of the upper ball is $3g$, and the acceleration of the lower balls is zero.
