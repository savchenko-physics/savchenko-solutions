###  Statement

$9.2.3.$ Find the distribution of magnetic field induction around an infinite straight wire carrying a current $I$.

### Solution

We write down the current strength by definition, we find the speed of current flow

$$
I = \frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{\lambda dl}{dt} = \lambda v \Rightarrow v = \frac{I}{\lambda}
$$

Field of a charged filament with linear charge density $\lambda$:

$$
E = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi\varepsilon_0 R}
$$

Where do we find the distribution of magnetic field induction around the wire?

$$
B = \varepsilon_0 \mu_0 Ev\Rightarrow \boxed{B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi R}}
$$

#### Answer

$$
B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi R}
$$
