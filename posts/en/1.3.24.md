###  Statement

$1.3.24.$ At a time when the particle velocity is $10^6~\mathrm{\frac{m}{s}}$, its acceleration is $10^4~\mathrm{\frac{m}{s^2}}$ and is directed at an angle of $30^\circ$ to the velocity. How much will the speed increase in $10^{-2}$ seconds? At what angle will the speed direction change? What is the angular velocity of rotation of the velocity vector at this moment?

### Solution

We decompose the acceleration into two components, tangential $a_\parallel $ and normal $a_\perp$:

$$
a_\parallel = a \cdot \cos 30^{\circ} = a \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
$$

$$
a_\perp = a \cdot \sin 30^{\circ}= a \frac{1}{2}
$$

During time $\Delta t$ the speed will increase by $\Delta v_\perp = a_\perp \Delta t$ and $\Delta v _\parallel = a_\parallel \Delta t$, in the transverse and longitudinal directions, respectively.

New speed values:

$$
v_\parallel = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a \Delta t +v_0
$$

$$
v_\perp = \frac{1}{2}a \Delta t
$$

Thus, the desired angle:

$$
\tan\alpha = \frac{v_\perp}{v_\parallel}
$$

Angular velocity

$$
\omega = \frac{\alpha}{t}
$$
