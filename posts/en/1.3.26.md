### Solution

For a body to fly along a parabola, it is necessary that at the moment of separation it be in a state of weightlessness

The force of gravity will be compensated by centrifugal force

$$ mg = \frac{mv^2}{r} $$ 

Where do we express $v$

$$\boxed{v = \sqrt{gr}}$$ 

#### Answer

$$v = \sqrt{gr}$$
