###  Statement 

$1.1.6.$ Athletes run in a column of length $l$ at speed $v$. The coach runs towards them with speed $u < v$. Each athlete, when he reaches the coach, turns around and starts running back with the same speed. What is the length of the column when all the athletes turn around? 

### Solution

Let us imagine stopping the column, then the coach besides his speed will have the speed of the column directed in the opposite direction. With this relative velocity $v + u$ he will during time 

$$t = \frac{l}{v + u}$$ 

will run along the column and equalise with the tail. The head of the column, having turned round, will move with relative velocity $v - u$ and after time 

$$t = \frac{{l}'}{v - u}$$ 

where ${l}'$ is the length of the new “column” after overtaking. Then 

$$\frac{{l}'}{v - u} = \frac{l}{v + u}$$ 

and the length of the new column 

$$\fbox{${l}' = \frac{v - u}{v + u}l$}$$ 

#### Answer

When all athletes turn around, the length of the new column will be equal to 
$${l}' = \frac{v - u}{v + u}l$$
