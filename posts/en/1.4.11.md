###  Statement

$1.4.11.$ The body is dropped over the slab at a height $h$ from it. The slab moves vertically upwards at a speed of $u$. Determine the time between two consecutive impacts of the body on the slab. The blows are absolutely elastic.

### Solution

Let's move to the reference frame associated with the plate. At the initial moment of time, the relative velocity is $u$ and is directed downwards.

From the law of conservation of energy, we find the velocity of the body $v$ at the moment before the impact

$$
\frac{mv^2}{2} = \frac{mu^2}{2} + mgh
$$

Where is the desired velocity

$$
v = \sqrt{u^2+2gh}
$$

In this inertial reference frame, after an elastic rebound, the relative velocity will only change direction.

A body thrown vertically will land after time

$$
t = \frac{2v}{g}
$$

Time sought:

$$
\fbox{$t = \frac{2\sqrt{u^2 + 2gh}}{g}$}
$$

#### Answer

$$
t = 2\sqrt{u^2/g^2 + 2h/g}
$$
