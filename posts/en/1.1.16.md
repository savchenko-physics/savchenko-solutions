###  Statement 

$1.1.16.$ A particle moves in one plane. From the graphs of the time dependence of the velocity projections $v_x$ and $v_y$ plot the trajectory of the particle if $x_{(0)} = 2$ m, $y_{(0)} = 1$ m.

### Solution

Taking into account the physical meaning of the area under the graph of velocity versus time, we obtain the graphs of the dependence of coordinate versus time. 

![ Graph of dependence $x(t)$ |416x286, 59%](../../img/1.1.16/graph1.png)  Graph of dependence $x(t)$  ![ Graph of dependence $y(t)$ |409x291, 59%](../../img/1.1.16/graph2.png)  Graph of dependence $y(t)$ 

Overlaying the graph of the dependence of $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ on each other at the corresponding time intervals, we obtain:
