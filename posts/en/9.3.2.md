###  Statement 

$9.3.2$ Find the magnetic field induction inside a flat capacitor moving at a speed of 9 m/s parallel to its plates. The distance between the plates is 10 mm, and voltage across them is 10 kV. 

### Solution

It's known that $$\vec{B} = \frac{\vec{v} \times \vec{E}}{c^2}$$ as $\vec{E} \perp \vec{v}$, $$B = \frac{vE}{c^2}$$ In this case, $U = Ed$, where $d$ is distance between plates, so $$B = \frac{vU}{dc^2}$$ 

#### Answer

$$B = 10^{-10}~{\rm{T}}$$
