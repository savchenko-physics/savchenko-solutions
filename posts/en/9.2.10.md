###  Statement

$9.2.10.$ A current $I$ flows through a ring of radius $R$. Determine the magnetic field induction at the center of the ring and on its axis at a distance $h$ from the center of the ring.

### Solution

![ The field induction at point $A$, located on the axis of the ring at a distance $z$ from its center |447x455, 39%](../../img/9.2.10/9.2.10_1.png)

The magnetic field $B$ will be directed perpendicular to the plane of the ring. Let's consider a section of the ring of length $Rd\theta$ for it the formula from [9.2.8](../9.2.8) will be valid then

$$
dB = \frac{\mu_0 I R}{4\pi (R^2 + h^2)}\cdot d\theta
$$

but since the field will be directed along the axis, its projection onto this axis is needed there

$$
dB\cdot \cos\alpha= \frac{\mu_0 I Rd\theta}{4\pi (R^2 + h^2)} \cdot \frac{R}{\sqrt{R^2 + h^2}}
$$

$$
dB_z = \frac{\mu_0 I R^2d\theta}{4\pi (R^2 + h^2)^{3/2}}
$$

When integrating $dB_z$ from $0$ to $2\pi$ we get:

$$
B(h)=\int_0^{2\pi}dB_z=\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{\mu_0 I R^2}{4\pi (R^2 + h^2)^{3/2}}~d\theta
$$

$$
B(h) = \frac{\mu_0 I R^2}{2 (R^2 + h^2)^{3/2}}
$$

substituting $h = 0$ we get the formula you know for the inductance in the center of the ring:

$$
B(0) = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2R}
$$

#### Answer

$$
B=\frac{\mu_0 qv}{4\pi r^2} \sin\alpha; \quad B = \frac{\mu_0 Il}{4\pi r^2}\sin\alpha
$$
