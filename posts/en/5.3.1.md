###  Statement

$5.3.1.$ At atmospheric pressure and a temperature of $0 \,^{\circ}C$, the mean free path of a hydrogen molecule is $0.1 ~\mu m$. Estimate the diameter of this molecule.

### Solution

To find the mean free path $\lambda$, it is necessary to find the volume that a particle must travel to meet another.

Each particle has a volume

$$
V=\frac{1}{n}\tag{1}
$$

In this case, a particle with an effective cross-section $S=\pi(2r)^2=\pi d^2$? cross-section at which it touches at least the edge of another particle, will pass through a volume

$$
V = \lambda \pi d^2\tag{2}
$$

If we assume that all other particles are at rest, then

$$
\lambda = \frac{1}{\pi d^2n}\tag{3}
$$

If the beam particle is part of an established equilibrium system with identical particles, then the square of the relative velocity is equal to:

$$
\overline{{v}_{\mathrm{relative}}^2}=\overline{({v}_1-{v}_2)^2}=\overline{{v}_1^2+{v}_2^2-2{v}_1\cdot{v}_2}\tag{4}
$$

At equilibrium, the values of the velocities ${\displaystyle {\overline { {v} _{1}\cdot {v} _{2}}}=0}$, and the relative velocity is equal at equilibrium, the values of the velocities

$$
{\displaystyle v_{\rm {rel}}={\sqrt {\overline {\ {v} _{\rm {relative}}^{2}}}}={\sqrt {\overline {\ {v} _{1}^{2}+\ {v} _{2}^{2}}}}={\sqrt {2}}v.}\tag{5}
$$

The mean free path of a particle in this case is then defined as

$$
\boxed{\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\pi d^2n}}\tag{6}
$$

From the formula for the mean free path we obtain that

$$
d=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\sqrt{2}\pi \lambda n}}\tag{7}
$$

The concentration of particles can be expressed through the Ideal Gas Law

$$
p=nkT_0\Rightarrow \boxed{n=\frac{p}{kT_0}}\tag{8}
$$

Substituting $(8)$ into $(7)$, we get

$$
\boxed{d=\frac{kT_0}{\sqrt{\sqrt{2}\pi \lambda p}}\approx 0.3 \text{ nm}}\tag{9}
$$

#### Answer

$$
d=\frac{kT_0}{\sqrt{\sqrt{2}\pi \lambda p}}\approx 0.3 \text{ nm}
$$
